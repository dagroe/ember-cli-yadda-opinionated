## Why Cucumber

Cucumber is a famous BDD implementation that gives exciting promises.



#### Acceptance tests in form of <em>user stories</em> offer a lot of benefits:

* provide <em>guarantees</em>
* and thus, they have business value
* integrate into the BDD cycle in a broader sense
* thread through all the feature life, from conception to deployment
* involve all team members: not only developers, but also managers, designers, product owners, customer representatives



#### Extensive user story coverage can be very helpful:

* reveals true size of features
* allows for more realistic estimations
* serves as a technical design specification
* is written in a human-readable language, understandable to non-developers
* serves as <em>the</em> source of truth for resolving disagreements
* simplifies progress tracking
* focuses on user needs, [rather than developer needs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44098.The_Inmates_Are_Running_the_Asylum)
* encourages creating numerous minimal test cases, as opposing to huge cases that attempt to test everything in one go
* integrates well into automated testing



## Cucumber's problems ‚Äî solved

Though Cucumber has a large army of faithful fans, it has an equally large amount of haters. Lots of developers have tried Cucumber and found that it caused more trouble than it solved.

Many, including me, have started as avid Cucumber enthusiasts and got severely disappointed, or got their teammates on ‚Äî or over ‚Äî the fence.

I'm convinced that it's not Cucumber to blame, it's the misuse that causes grief. In much the same way, it would be ridiculous to advocate against using knives in the kitchen because you have cut your finger. üòè

I have identified a number of issues with how Cucumber is typically used and, I believe, successfully solved them. The resulting approach is quite radical and quite effective. Read on!
